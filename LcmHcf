# LCM AND HCF
# HCF is also called GCD Greated Common Divisor

# Given a and b
# a * b = LCM * HCF
# So from above if we have two numbers and GCD we can compute LCM also

# Lets see how to compute GCD


# Basic Euclidean Algorithm for HCF
def gcd(a,b):
    if a == 0:
        return b
    return gcd(b%a,a)

a = int(input())
b = int(input())
HCF = gcd(a,b)
LCM = (a*b) / HCF

print("HCF :-",HCF)
print("LCM :-",LCM)

#Time Complexity: O(log(min(a, b)))
#Important properties of LCM and HCF:
#For two numbers say, 'a' and 'b', LCM x HCF = a x b.
#HCF of co-primes = 1.
#For two fractions,
#HCF = HCF (Numerators) / LCM (Denominators)
#LCM = LCM (Numerators) / HCF (Denominators)
